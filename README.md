ðŸ’“ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
* This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. 
* It includes data preprocessing, model training using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
* The goal is to provide accurate and interpretable predictions to assist in early diagnosis.
