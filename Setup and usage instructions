⚙️ Setup and Usage Instructions (Bullet Points)
1) Clone the repository or download the ZIP file of the project.

2) Install Python 3.8 or above if it's not already installed on your system.

3) Install required Python packages by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run train_model.py to:

4) Load and preprocess the dataset

5) Train SVM and Random Forest classifiers

6) Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

7) Save the best-performing model and scaler

8) Output evaluation metrics and performance plots

9) Trained model files are saved as:

heart_disease_model.pkl – the best model (Random Forest)

scaler.pkl – the StandardScaler used

model_columns.pkl – list of feature names used during training

All results (including ROC curves and metrics) can be found in the project directory after running the script.
